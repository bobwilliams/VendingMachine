# VendingMachine
A very simple vending machine model for learning different languages

## Problem
Model a 6x10x20 snack vending machine

**machine**
* 6 rows
* 10 cols
* 20 items deep

**inputs**
* currency
* row / col selection

**outputs**
* snack item
* change
* error/prompt messaging

## Some things to look for
* Data Structures
* Class Hierarchies/Explosion
* Algorithms
* Mutable/Immutable Data/State
* Simplicity/Complexity
* Persistence

## Extra credit
* Localization
  * currency 
  * names
* Unit Testing

## Notes
* this is usually just a thinking exercise to see how the candidate breaks a problem down
* do not ask to write code
* see if the candidate can think on his/her feet
* get a sense of how they approach the problem
* what do they think about/what do they not think about
